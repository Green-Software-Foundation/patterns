State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/reduce-network-traversal-between-VMs","title":"Reduce network traversal between VMs","description":"Description","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/reduce-network-traversal-between-VMs"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/scale-down-kubernetes-workloads","title":"Scale down kubernetes applications when not in use","description":"In order to reduce carbon emissions and costs, Dev&Test Kubernetes clusters can turn off nodes out of office hours.

In practice, however, it\'s difficult to correlate your application\'s demand drivers with CPU and RAM utilization. Scaling your workload based on relevant demand metrics that drive scaling of your applications, such as HTTP requests, queue length, and cloud alerting events can help reduce resource utilization, and therefore also your carbon emissions.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/scale-kubernetes-workloads-based-on-events"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/scale-logical-components-independently","title":"Scale logical components independently","description":"Description","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/scale-logical-components-independently"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/scan-for-vulnerabilities","title":"Scan for vulnerabilities","description":"Many attacks on cloud infrastructure seek to misuse deployed resources, which leads to an unnecessary spike in usage and cost.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/scan-for-vulnerabilities"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/evaluate-whether-to-use-TLS-termination","title":"Terminate TLS at border gateway","description":"Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures that all data passed between the web server and web browsers remain private and encrypted.

State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/match-slo","title":"Match your service level objectives to business needs","description":"If service downtimes are acceptable it\'s better to not strive for highest availability but to design the solution according to real business needs.

Typically, a development environment is used for regular updates, while staging or testing enviroments are used to make sure there are no issues before code reaches a production environment where users may have access. Each added environment has an increasing energy impact, which in turn creates more emissions. As such, it is important to understand the necessity of each enviroment and it\'s environmental impact.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/minimizing-deployed-environments"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/optimize-impact-on-customer-equipment","title":"Optimize impact on customer devices and equipment","description":"Description","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/optimize-impact-on-customer-equipment"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/queue-non-urgent-requests","title":"Queue non-urgent processing requests","description":"All systems have periods of peak and low load.

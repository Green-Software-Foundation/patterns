# Use SOLID principles

## Description

From a software design perspective, the way how we write and organise code also contributes to the energy consumed by the software. What contributes to that is the number of cpu cycles that are introduced by different stylings.

## Solution

Make sure to stay conform to the SOLID principles when designing software and writing code.

## SCI Impact

`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`  
[Software Carbon Intensity Spec](https://grnsft.org/sci)

Staying conform to the SOLID principles, will impact SCI as follows: 

- `E`: When implementing each of the principles in SOLID, will lower the number of CPU cycles and therefore lower the energy consumed by the CPU when the application when performing its tasks. 
- `I`:  Consuming less energy will also reduce the intensity of carbon emissions.
